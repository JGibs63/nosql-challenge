Scenario:
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors 
of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The challenge is divided into two parts: setting up the data, and analyzing it. I was given the database to import, as well as instructions to update the database with a specific
restaurant, "Penang Flavours." The magazine was not interested in any establishments in Dover, so those locations were also removed from the database. Lastly, I was able to analyze
the data to answer the magazine's questions about local establishments including location, hygiene, and rating values.
